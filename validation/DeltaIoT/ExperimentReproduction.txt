* Since the SimExp UI is currently work-in-progress, we created a corresponding project which includes the java sources for experiment reproduction

* Clone and import SimExp
** Clone the latest git repository of SimExp
** Import all bundles into your eclipse workspace
** Import all org.palladiosimulator.simexp.pcm.examples.deltaiot* projects from the examples folder

* Setup
** Check whether in SimExpServiceRegistration.java (.\Palladio-Analyzer-SimExp\bundles\org.palladiosimulator.simexp.workflow\src\org\palladiosimulator\simexp\workflow\jobs) the class DeltaIoTSimulationExecutor is registered. If not, replace the class with currently registered class.
** Moreover, DeltaIoTSimulationExecutor contains all experiments settings (e.g. number of trajectories, ...) and the adaptation strategy to be evaluated. Therefore, comment out the strategy to be evaluated.
*** Note that if variants of the quality-based strategy are supposed to be evaluated, make sure that the proper energy consumption bounds are used.
** Afterwards configure and run a new eclipse instance in the run configurations and let it run.
** Import the project org.palladiosimulator.envdyn.examples.deltaiot (located in this folder) in the newly created eclipse instance.

* Execute SimExp
** Create a new SimExp run configuration and let it run.
