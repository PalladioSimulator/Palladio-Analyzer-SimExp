* Since the SimExp UI is currently work-in-progress, we created a corresponding project which includes the java sources for experiment reproduction

* Clone and import SimExp
** Clone the latest git repository of SimExp
** Import all bundles into your eclipse workspace
** Import the org.palladiosimulator.simexp.pcm.examples.loadbalancing project from the examples folder

* Setup
** Check whether in SimExpServiceRegistration.java (.\Palladio-Analyzer-SimExp\bundles\org.palladiosimulator.simexp.workflow\src\org\palladiosimulator\simexp\workflow\jobs) the class LoadBalancingSimulationExecutor is registered. If not, replace the class with currently registered class.
** Moreover, LoadBalancingSimulationExecutor contains all experiments settings (e.g. number of trajectories, ...) and the adaptation strategy to be evaluated. Therefore, comment out the strategy to be evaluated.
** Afterwards configure and run a new eclipse instance in the run configurations and let it run.
** Import the project org.palladiosimulator.simexp.pcm.examples.loadbalancer (located in this folder) in the newly created eclipse instance.

* Execute SimExp
** To select the usage evolution for evluation, navigate to the InterarrivalRateEvolution.usageevolution file. Within the file, the respective usage evolutions can be selected (i.e. constant, linear and peak evolution).
** Depending on the adaptatio strategy to be evaluated, copy the corresponding model transformations (representing the adaptations) from the reconfigurations_simexp-folder to the reconfigurations_active-folder.
** Create a new SimExp run configuration and let it run.
** Important remark: For some reasons the first SimExp run craches (we could not identify the source of error). If you run SimExp again, everything works as expected.

* Execute SimuLizar
** Within the inner eclipse instance, create a respective Simulizar run config.
** Before execution, copy the model transformations (depending on the adaptation strategy to be evaluated) from the reconfigurations_simulizar-folder to the reconfigurations_active-folder.
